# CCM Generator

A small web app that builds a **CALTech Course Manual (CCM)** as a Word file from a syllabus, the number of lectures and the class slot.

Everything runs in the browser. There is no server, no build step and no dependency: the `.docx` is written directly by `docgen.js`. Nothing you type is uploaded (the form is autosaved in your own browser's local storage).

## Quick start (two uploads)
1. **Upload the syllabus PDF** (section 0). The code, title, objectives, outcomes, units with hours, guest lecture, books and suggested experiments are read from it. If the PDF is a scan, or does not read properly, paste its text into the box below the button instead.
2. **Upload the class list** (section 3): VTOP “Date of lecture” page(s) or an Excel/CSV sheet.
3. Add faculty / semester details, check the form, click **Create session plan**, then download one class or all classes.

The PDF reader (pdf.js, Apache-2.0) is bundled in `lib/pdfjs-main.js` and `lib/pdfjs-worker.js` as plain scripts, so it works from your GitHub Pages link **and** when `index.html` is opened straight from a folder, with no internet. Upload the whole `lib` folder together with the app. (`tools-build-pdfjs.py` regenerates these two files from a newer pdfjs-dist build.)

### Syllabus layouts that are understood
* the older VIT “Unit No. / Unit Content / No. of hours / SOs” table (e.g. CSE3011),
* the newer VIT layout with a *Course code · Course title · L T P J C* row and **Module:1 … 6 hours** headings,
* **Unit I / UNIT-1 / Chapter 1** headings with hours in brackets (theory only courses),
* lab-only courses (no lecture units): the list of experiments becomes the session topics,
* PDFs that contain several courses: pick the course from a list.

Course objectives / outcomes may be numbered, bulleted or written as sentences. Text and reference books, experiments, guest lecture, BoS / Academic-Council lines are picked up when present.

**Always check the form after reading a PDF.** Reading is pattern based, so an unusual layout can leave parts empty or mis-split, and the app lists warnings for what it could not find. The unit → CO links are guessed from matching words. Scanned PDFs (pictures of text) cannot be read; paste the text instead.

## What you enter

| Section | Fields |
|---|---|
| Course details | code, title, type, credits, slot (e.g. `F11+F12`), semester, faculty, … |
| Syllabus | objectives, course outcomes, units (title, hours, SOs, COs, topics), books, BoS/approval dates, experiments |
| Lectures | total sessions (e.g. 22), guest lectures, optional start date, class days and holidays |
| Mapping | CO–SO and CO–PO/PSO matrices |
| Classes (optional) | VTOP “Date of lecture” pages (.html), or an Excel/CSV sheet with `Class ID`, `Date` (+ optional `Slot`, `Venue`) |

## Class-wise CCMs
Upload one VTOP “Date of lecture” page per class (File → Save page as… → HTML), or one Excel/CSV sheet that lists several classes. The app reads the class ID, slot, venue, course code/title and every lecture date, then:
* builds a separate plan per class (number of sessions = number of dates for that class),
* puts the class ID, slot, venue and real lecture dates in that class's CCM,
* lets you download one class as `.docx`, or all classes in one `.zip`.

Excel/CSV layout (header row required, see **Download CSV template**):

| Class ID | Date | Slot | Venue |
|---|---|---|---|
| BL2026270100324 | 14-07-2026 | F11+F12 | AB02-301 |

Dates may be Excel dates or text (`14-07-2026`, `2026-07-14`, `14-Jul-2026`).

## What you get

Cover page, contents, ABET/NBA outcomes, syllabus page, CO–SO and CO–PO mapping, course plan table, assessment tools, CO attainment table, one **session-plan page per lecture**, and a starter model question paper.

### How the session plan is made
1. Lectures (total minus guest lectures) are shared between units in proportion to their hours (largest-remainder rounding, at least one each).
2. The unit's topic list is split into consecutive groups, one per lecture. If a unit has 3+ sessions and *activity* is ticked, its last session becomes "Activity on Unit n".
3. Experiments are spread evenly over the sessions as the after-class activity.
4. Dates are assigned from the start date on the chosen class days, skipping holidays.
5. Before-class, entry/exit ticket, material and weightage text come from templates; **every field can be edited** in the preview before you download.

The plan is rule based, so the topic grouping is a starting point. Review it and adjust.

## Publish on GitHub Pages
1. Create a repository and push these files to the `main` branch.
2. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source** to **GitHub Actions**.
3. The included workflow (`.github/workflows/pages.yml`) deploys the site on every push. Your app will be at `https://<user>.github.io/<repo>/`.

Without Actions you can also choose *Deploy from a branch → main / (root)*.

## Run locally
Open `index.html` in a browser, or serve the folder (`python3 -m http.server`).

Tests (need Node 18+; the browser tests also need `playwright` with Chromium and LibreOffice for `soffice`):
* `node test/generate.js` – writes `test/out.docx` from the Python sample.
* `node test/fuzz.js` – 300 random syllabi / lecture counts: planning and document writing must never fail and no topic may be lost.
* `node test/parse.js test/sample-syllabus.pdf test/fixtures/*.pdf` – shows what the syllabus reader finds in each PDF.
* `node test/filecheck.js` – opens index.html from a folder (file://) and reads the sample PDF.
* `node test/e2e.js` – drives the real page: syllabus PDF → class list → plan → .docx, for every sample PDF.

## Notes
* Contents-page numbers are not filled in automatically.
* The logo and the standard ABET/NBA outcome wording come from the VIT Bhopal CCM template. Untick *Show logo* for other institutions.
* Files: `planner.js` (session planning), `importers.js` (VTOP / Excel / CSV readers), `syllabus.js` (syllabus PDF reader), `lib/` (bundled pdf.js), `docgen.js` (Word + ZIP writer), `app.js` (UI), `sample.js` (CSE3011 example).
